    - L6 (layer 6 - presentation layer thing)
    - 1995, at Netscape
    - establish encrypted communications between web servers/clients
        - encrypts the data received from L7 and passes encrypted data to L5
        - decrypts the data received from L5 and passes decrypted data to L7
    - leveraged by HTTPS protocol
    - provides privacy and data integrity 
    - uses public-key exchange 
    - version 1, 2, 3, all deprecated
- TLS
    - transport layer security protocol
    - successor of SSL
    - 1999, by IETF
    - L6 (layer 6 - presentation layer thing)
    - establish encrypted communications between web servers/clients
        - encrypts the data received from L7 and passes encrypted data to L5
        - decrypts the data received from L5 and passes decrypted data to L7
    - leveraged by HTTPS protocol, can be used
    - provides privacy and data integrity 
    - version 1.0, 1.1 are deprecated and 1.2 & 1.3 are available
- SSL vs TLS
    - In short, a better version of SSL
    - https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/ssl-vs-tls
    - There is no SSL certificate and TLS certificates, they're just certificates which works for both the protocols
        - both are X.509 digital certificates that helps authenticate the server and facilitate the handshake process
- TLS SNI: Server Name Indication, is an addition to the TLS encryption protocol that enables a client device to specify the domain name it is trying to reach in the first step of the TLS handshake, preventing common name mismatch errors.
- DSCP
    - Differentiated Services Code Point
    - Is a packet header value
    - That can be used to request (for example) high priority or best effort delivery of the traffic

- DHCP
    - Dynamic Hosting Configuration Protocol
    - L2-L3 (Network Layer to Transport Layer)
    - Is a NMP (N/W management protocol), helps automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks
    - Thus assigning devices IP address
        - so that IPs don't need to be manually assigned by an admin each time a device connects
    - Thus allowing them to use network service like NAT, DNS and any communication protocols based on UDP or TCP
    - DHCP is also responsible for the configuration of domain name server (DNS) and subnet masks, as well as default gateways

- NAT
    - Network Address Translation
    - Is a method of remapping an IP address space into another by modifying the network address information in IP header  of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device
    - Means, it enables private IP networks that uses unregistered IP address to connect to internet
        - by translating the unregistered (not globally unique) IP addresses in internal network into legal address
        - before packets are forwarded to another network

    - process
        - hit a URL (say api.example.com)
        - DNS lookup starts
        - queries __recursive resolver__ which can be ISP, wireless carrier, etc.
        - __recursive resolver__ redirects the query to __root server__
        - __root server__ keeps map of all the __top level domain__ (e.g. .com, .net) with __top level domain (TLD) server's address__
        - __root server__ redirects the query for `.com` part to a __TLD server__
        - __TLD server__ keeps map of all the top level domains with __domain's name server__
        - __TLD server__ finds the __domain's name server__ for `example.com` and redirects the query there
        - __domain's name server__ keeps map of all the subdomains with IP address
        - request reaches to domain's DNS server with unsolved puzzle part (i.e. `api.example.com`)
        - domain's DNS server returns the IP address to __recursive resolver__ server
        - __recursive resolver__ server shares the IP address with client/browser
        - webpage appears

- 5G vs WiFi6
    - WiFi naming convention for past and current generation tech has been simplified
        - Wi-Fi 6 means 802.11ax technology – the new generation of Wi-Fi, present in many new routers you'll buy from now on - but not many devices as yet.
            - enhancement: at PHY layer, better traffic management, better multi-client mgnt
        - Wi-Fi 5 means 802.11ac technology – effectively the current generation
        - Wi-Fi 4 means 802.11n technology – many people will have networking gear based on 802.11n, but it was replaced by 802.11ac in many new routers from 2013 on.

    - OUI organizationally unique identifier
