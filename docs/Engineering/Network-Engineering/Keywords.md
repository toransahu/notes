    - TLS: TLS is a security protocol that provides privacy and data integrity for Internet communications. Implementing TLS is a standard practice for building secure web apps.
        - Privacy
        - Data integrity
    - SSL vs TLS
        - In short, a better version of SSL
        - https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/ssl-vs-tls
    - TLS SNI: Server Name Indication, is an addition to the TLS encryption protocol that enables a client device to specify the domain name it is trying to reach in the first step of the TLS handshake, preventing common name mismatch errors.
- DSCP
    - Differentiated Services Code Point
    - Is a packet header value
    - That can be used to request (for example) high priority or best effort delivery of the traffic

- DHCP
    - Dynamic Hosting Configuration Protocol
    - Is a NMP (N/W management protocol), helps automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks
    - Thus assigning devices IP address
        - so that IPs don't need to be manually assigned by an admin each time a device connects
    - Thus allowing them to use network service like NAT, DNS and any communication protocols based on UDP or TCP
    - DHCP is also responsible for the configuration of domain name server (DNS) and subnet masks, as well as default gateways

- NAT
    - Network Address Translation
    - Is a method of remapping an IP address space into another by modifying the network address information in IP header  of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device
    - Means, it enables private IP networks that uses unregistered IP address to connect to internet
        - by translating the unregistered (not globally unique) IP addresses in internal network into legal address
        - before packets are forwarded to another network

- dBm - decibels with milliwatt (mW) reference

    - 10 dBm (1mW) is 10 times powerful than 0 dBm
    - 20 dBm (100mW) is 10 times powerful than 10 dBm
- RX (Receive) vs. TX (Transmit) 
- Ionizing vs non-ionizing radiation
- 5G vs WiFi6
    - WiFi naming convention for past and current generation tech has been simplified
        - Wi-Fi 6 means 802.11ax technology – the new generation of Wi-Fi, present in many new routers you'll buy from now on - but not many devices as yet.
        - Wi-Fi 5 means 802.11ac technology – effectively the current generation
        - Wi-Fi 4 means 802.11n technology – many people will have networking gear based on 802.11n, but it was replaced by 802.11ac in many new routers from 2013 on.
    - WiFi6 > 5G
    - OEM original equipment manufacturer
    - OUI organizationally unique identifier
        - a 24-bit number that uniquely identifies a vendor, manufacturer, or other organization
