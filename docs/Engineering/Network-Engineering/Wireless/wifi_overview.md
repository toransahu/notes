# Standards Organizations

- Many manufacturer create devices
- Standards must be created and adhered to in order to assure seamless operability

## IEEE

- Name: Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers
- Who: The professional society who creates and maintains standards for diff technologies including network, that we use
- Purpose: Creates & sets standards for betterment of humanity
- Special Mention: 802.11 group was responisble for creating the Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard

## IETF

- Name: Internet Engineering Task Force
- Who: International community of people in networking industry
- Purpose: produce technical docs about design, use, & management of internet


## Wi-Fi Alliance

![Wi-Fi Alliance Certified Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/WiFi_Logo.svg)

- Name: Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) - 1999, later Wi-Fi Alliance
- Purpose: Compliance enforcement body by ensuring interoperability of WLAN products via certification testing
- Who: In 1999, Aironet (aquired by Cisco), Nokia, Symbol Technologies (now Motorola), and 3 others formed WECA

# Standards
## 802.11

- Creator: IEEE 
- Maintainer: IEEE
- What: Standard for WLAN communication (LAN communication using radio frequency [RF])
- Why: To set one single way to achieve it - as there are many ways
- Who: 400 active members, 200 wireless companies - can make suggestions
    - 802.11
- How
    - 1997
    - included only transmission types FHSS & DSSS
    - 2.4 GHz band
    - Speed: 1-2 Mbps

## 802.11a

- How
    - 1999 (same year as .11b)
    - 5 GHz
    - 54 Mbps (but much less range than 11b)
    - High cost & shorter distance

## 802.11b

- How
    - 1999 (same year as .11a)
    - 2.4 GHz
    - 11 Mbps (but much more range than 11a)
    - did better in market w.r.t 11a

## 802.11g 

- How
    - 2003
    - 2.4 GHz
    - 54 Mbps
    - Compatible with 802.11b

## 802.11n 

- How
    - 2009
    - 2.4 & 5 GHz
    - Introduced MIMO - Multiple input, multiple output
        - channel aggregation
        - multiple antennas
    - 600 Mbps (theoritical)
    - Compatible with 802.11b

## 802.11ac 

- How
    - 2014
    - 5 GHz
    - Enhanced MIMO - Multiple input, multiple output
        - extended channel bandwidth (11n's 40 MHz) to 80 MHz
        - increased MIMO functionality & capability
    - 7 Gbps (theoritical)
    - Utilizes __Beanforming__ as core part of the Special
    - Detects devices and intensify signal in their direction
    - This compensates for shorter range limitations of 5 GHz band

## 802.3 

- Creator: IEEE 
- Maintainer: IEEE
- What: Standard for LAN communication (LAN communication using wired network / ethernet cable)

# Regulatory Bodies

- Why: WiFi is based on radio frequency. There are multiple frequencies available under RF spectrum. Using frequencies at will would eventually disable all communication.
- Purpose: To keep the RF spectrum organized and open for fair use

## ITU-R

- International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication sector
- Regions covered:
    1. Europe, Africa, Northern Asia
    2. North & South America
    3. Southern Asia
- Make sure RF signal from one country do not interefer with signals of another country


## FCC

- Federal Communications Commission
- Regulates
    - RF frequencies
    - channels
    - transmission power
- In: United States and several countries in the America
- www.fcc.gov

## ETSI

- European Telecommunication Standards Institute
- European counterpart to the FCC
