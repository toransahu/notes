# GraphQL

[TOC]

# Intro
- An architectural and conceptual improvement over REST.
- GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.
- It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.

## REST vs GraphQL
Lets say, we are consuming Facebook API

A typical nested field data distribution:
```
    FACEBOOK
    |
    |------ USERS
    |       |------- TORAN
    |                |----- INFO
    |                |       
    |                |
    |                |
    |                |----- ASSETS
    |                       |
```
    - GraphQL can retrieve various fields from different endpoint routes in fewer or single query
    - whereas REST requires multiple calls for each fields
    - e.g.
        - REST
        ```bash
        
        ```
