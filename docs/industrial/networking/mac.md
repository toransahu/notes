# MAC

Media Access Control

- The IEEE manages MAC addresses
-

## How many combinations / Sufficient?
- 12 digits (0-F i.e. 16 possible chars)
- 16^12=2.81E14
- 281 trillion
- 281, 474, 980, 000, 000
- two hundred and eighty-one trillion, four hundred and seventy-four billion, nine hundred and eighty million

## Are MAC addresses really unique?

Or are there any (maybe cloned?) network interface cards that have the same MAC address as another NIC?

What is the probability of having two identical MAC addresses within one network?

- The hardware identification addresses that the IEEE distributes are unique. That makes the probability of matching MAC addresses zero.
- On the other hand, some hardware MAC addresses are programmable, which makes them spoofable. This means that it is possible for two machines in the same network to have the same MAC address.
