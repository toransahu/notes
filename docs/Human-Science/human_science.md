# Verbal Abuse

> Verbally abusing or attacking another is a maladaptive behavior that can be occasionally displayed by anyone, especially during stressful times or times when one is experiencing significant physical discomfort. It can also be used as a defensive mechanism when an individual feels like he or she is being attacked by another individual, or as a method of achieving vengeance on an individual. However, verbal abusive behaviors can also be used to intentionally manipulate others.

> When an individual starts verbally abusing another, the intensity and the frequency of abuse tend to increase over time.

>  It can be as harmful as physical abuse, and can negatively impact the victimâ€™s health.[14] The victims of verbal abuse may suffer from emotional pain and mental distress, which over time could lead to succumbing due to stress-related illness

> Victims of verbal abuse are three times more likely to develop personality disorders.

> Parents who verbally abuse their children may cause their children to develop personality disorders during adolescence and young adulthood.
